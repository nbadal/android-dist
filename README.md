# Android Platform Distribution

[Android's documentation](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards) used to have details about the current plaform distribution, 
but it has since moved to Android Studio's new project wizard. This site provides a shortcut to that data for folks who don't have
Android Studio, or are just lazy like me.
